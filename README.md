# Introduction
This project is for practicing socket programming and threads using java by trying to simulate game's character position coordinating.

## how to run
run `GameServer.java`
then run `ClientUI.java`

## Note 
Snake directory is deprecated. I tried to make a snake game first but at that moment I lack knowledge of how to use socket and thread in Java.
It's used to be my playground on this project
